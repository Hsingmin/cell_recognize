# cell_recognize

Use YOLO or Fast-RCNN network to recognize the adherent cells in test images.

A tmp sample parasitized cell image dataset can be accessed from:

And we can also get a red-blood-cell dataset from https://github.com/cosmicad/dataset

Use this dataset the train a demo to recognize red-blood-cell, and changed to adherent cell dataset
to re-train the model in the future if the dataset is ready.
